# SolarGuard-Intelligent-Defect-Detection-on-Solar-Panels-using-DeepLearning
Solar energy is a crucial renewable resource, but the accumulation of dust, snow, bird droppings, and physical/electrical damage on solar panels reduces their efficiency. While manual monitoring is time-consuming and expensive, automated detection can help improve efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.

This project focuses on image classification using the ResNet50 deep learning model. The key steps involved in the workflow include:

Image Classification with ResNet50:-
  Utilized the pre-trained ResNet50 model to classify images effectively, leveraging transfer learning techniques.

Data Preparation & Organization:-
  Reorganized raw image data into train and validation folders to comply with the ResNet50 input requirements.

Preprocessing & Augmentation:-
  Applied data augmentation techniques and resized images to improve model generalization. The final trained model was saved for deployment.

Streamlit App Deployment:-
  Developed a user-friendly Streamlit web application to showcase the trained model's classification capabilities in real time.
